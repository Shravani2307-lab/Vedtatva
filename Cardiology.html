      <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Chest Discomfort</strong>
          <p>
            It’s the most common sign of heart danger. If you have a blocked
            artery or are having a heart attack, you may feel pain, tightness,
            or pressure in your chest.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nausea, Indigestion, Heartburn, or Stomach Pain</strong>
          <p>
            Some people have these symptoms during a heart attack. They may even
            vomit, Chambers says. Women are more likely to report this type of
            symptom than men are. You can have an upset stomach for many reasons
            that have nothing to do with your heart. It could just be something
            you ate, after all. But you need to be aware that it can also happen
            during a heart attack.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pain that Spreads to the Arm</strong>
          <p>
            Another classic heart attack symptom is pain that radiates down the
            left side of the body. "It almost always starts from the chest and
            moves outward," Chambers says. "But I have had some patients who
            have mainly arm pain that turned out to be heart attacks."
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>You Feel Dizzy or Lightheaded</strong>
          <p>
            A lot of things can make you lose your balance or feel faint for a
            moment. Maybe you didn’t have enough to eat or drink, or you stood
            up too fast. But if you suddenly feel unsteady and you also have
            chest discomfort or shortness of breath, get medical help right
            away. "It could mean your blood pressure has dropped because your
            heart isn't able to pump the way it should," Bufalino says.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Throat or Jaw Pain</strong>
          <p>
            By itself, throat or jaw pain probably isn't heart related. More
            likely, it's caused by a muscular issue, a cold, or a sinus problem.
            But if you have pain or pressure in the center of your chest that
            spreads up into your throat or jaw, it could be a sign of a heart
            attack.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Irregular Heart Beat</strong>
          <p>
            It can benormal for your heart to race when you are nervous or
            excited or to skip or add a beat once in a while. But if you have
            started feeling palpitations, check in with your doctor. "CALL 911"
            if you have palpitations or an irregular heartbeat that persists or
            if you also have any chest pain or pressure, dizziness, or shortness
            of breath.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Snoring</strong>
          <p>
            It’s normal to snore a little while you snooze. But unusually loud
            snoring that sounds like a gasping or choking can be a sign of sleep
            apnea. That’s when you stop breathing for brief moments several
            times at night while you are still sleeping. This puts extra stress
            on your heart.

      <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
      <p>Explore various treatment options for heart health:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Panchkarma Treatment for Heart Disease</strong>
          <p>
            Our doctors mainly recommend Virechana (purification therapy) and
            Basti (enema therapy) in Panchkarma Ayurvedic treatment for heart
            disease.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>External Ayurvedic treatments for heart disease</strong>
          <p>
            Apart from Panchkarma, several external Ayurvedic treatments for
            heart disease are considered very beneficial in soothing and
            supporting heart patients, and these Ayurvedic treatments also help
            prevent heart disease effectively. . The most recommended external
            Ayurvedic treatments for heart disease are Abhyanga or full body
            massage and Shiro dhara. Abhyanga massage is performed by therapists
            using warm medicated oils by moving hands in sync over the entire
            body, including the Marma points. And Shiro dhara helps balance and
            nourish the sixth chakra, and removes possible spiritual blockages
            from that particular chakra. This Dhara treatment involves applying
            a stream of hot oil, buttermilk, milk or ghee (clarified butter) to
            the center of the forehead.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hrid Basti</strong>
          <p>
            In Hrid Basti, hot medicinal oil or herbal decoction is poured over
            the heart area. Benefits include: Cardiomyopathy; reduces pain in
            this area; strengthens chest muscles; Normalizes heart function and
            calms Vata. This helps eliminate negative emotions such as
            unresolved anger, frustration, and sadness.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hridya Mudra</strong>
          <p>
            This mudra or hand alignment is specially designed for people with
            heart diseases, however people with high blood pressure and
            palpitations can also get favorable results by practicing it. The
            index finger must be fixed at the base of the thumb. Next, touch the
            tip of your thumb to the tip of your middle and ring fingers
            together. Keep your little finger straight. This hand alignment for
            heart disease can be done once or twice a day for a period of two to
            five minutes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stress control </strong>
          <p>
            Since Ayurvedic treatments aim for a holistic approach to
            alleviating heart disease, the focus is on nurturing both the
            emotional and physical heart. Mental and emotional stress can
            disrupt the emotional core and this is why stress management is
            considered essential for recovery from heart disease.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Preventing heart disease is most important</strong>
          <p>
            Vedic wisdom focuses on heart disease based on four main factors.
            These factors not only lay the foundation for heart disease but also
            have a lasting effect in reducing the disease. When you are aware of
            these lifestyle factors, you can understand your perception of the
            need to prevent heart disease more easily. We must understand that
            although heart diseases have taken us by surprise today, we can
            still prevent them. • Aachar – (Character and behavior) • Vichar
            (perception and thought process) • Vyavhaar (attitude and behavior)
            • Aahar (diet and daily eating habits)
          </p>

          <strong>Home remedies for heart disease</strong>
          <p>
            One of the home remedies for the heart can be prepared with garlic,
            a heart-healthy herb. You should chew two to three cloves of garlic
            and drink the juice slowly, preferably on an empty stomach in the
            morning.

            About. One to three grams of cinnamon powder, a medicinal herb that
            supports heart disease, can be taken twice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Take half a cup of freshly ground squash juice. To do this, add 7 to
            8 basil and mint leaves. Drink this mixture 2 times.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grapes are also recommended for people with heart disease. Indeed,
            sweet, viscous and cold in nature, grapes have a calming and
            soothing effect on the heart.
