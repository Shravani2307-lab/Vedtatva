      <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>VICHARCHIKA or Eczema</strong>
          <p>
            It is characterized by itching, dryness of skin and flaking. Scratching of the skin results in rashes.
        affects the ears, central face, nasolabial folds and eyebrows, armpits, umbilicus, breasts & groin.
        It also affects the scalp; when eczema affects the scalp, it is marked by scaling (dandruff) 
        Eczema is triggered when the immunity of the body is impacted - the trigger may be caused due to various reasons like
         irritants (soap, shampoos, detergents, disinfectants, vegetables, meats) allergens (pets, pollen, dust mites), bacteria, hot and humid temperature, perspiration, food
         items (stale, spicy, fermented, fried, sour,dry food items),  stress and irregular schedules, excessive intake of items like tea, coffee, alcohol, aerated beverages.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> KITIBHA/KSHUDRA KUSHTHA (Psoriasis)</strong>
          <p>
            Psoriasis can be caused due to many reasons. Some of the most common reasons are genetic predispositions, 
            consumption of opposite foods (such as fish and milk/curd together, consumption of equal quantities of ghee and honey etc.),
            exposure of the skin due to cuts, bruises or burns and application or consumption of medicines/skin irritants. 
            Additional causes could include excessive smoking, alcohol consumption and mental stress.
          </p>

          <strong>YAUVANPIDIKA or Acne Vulgaris</strong>
          <p>
            Yauvanpidika in Ayurveda - yauvan referring to ‘adolescence’ and pidika referring to ‘pustules or papules’. It is also referred to as Mukha Dooshika (Acne Vulgaris)
         Acne usually erupts in the form of black heads, white heads, pimples or nodules. The affected regions are mostly the face, back, upper chest and shoulders 
         (areas densely populated with sebaceous glands). Skin is also often greasy in this condition. Inflammatory papules, nodules and cysts occurs and it leaves scar on face.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>KILASA/SWITRA or Vitiligo (Leucoderma)</strong>
          <p>
            Kilasa or Switra in Ayurveda, is a pigmentation disorder in which the skin pigment cells (melanocytes or cells that create pigments in the skin) get destroyed.
        Owing to this, de-pigmented (white) patches appear on different parts of the body. Vitiligo generally affects the hands, wrists, knees, neck and back. It may also affect the mucous membrane and the retina. 
        The hair of scalp and beard may also be de-pigmented. In this situation, hair that grows from the affected patches may assume a white colour. 
        researchers suggest auto-immunological (condition in which the immunity system itself attacks the body), neurological or auto-cytotoxic causes. Also included in the list by medical experts are acute gastric disorders,
        calcium deficiency, burns, intra-lesional steroid injections, mental stress, impairment of liver, skin irritation due to wearing tight clothes, use of stickers or tattoos on the skin etc. Additionally, 
        Vitiligo can be related to certain auto-immune and inflammatory diseases such as Thyroid, Diabetes, Psoriasis and Pernicious Anemia. Vitiligo may also be hereditary.

      <h2>Treatment in Ayurveda</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>VICHARCHIKA or Eczema</strong>
        <p>
            Eczema or Vicharchika is triggered due to the vitiation of the pitha dosha. 
            Treatments to pacify the pitha dosha stabilize the body's digestive system and eliminate the accumulated toxins
            Thus, the treatments focus on detoxification and cleansing. Apart from this, other Ayurvedic remedies such as Udhwarthanam
            (massage with dry herbal powders),Lepam (face packs with natural or medicated herbs)  Dhoopanam (medicated fumigation) are also
            effectively administered depending on the patients condition. Oral medication is also be prescribed where required. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>KITIBHA/KSHUDRA KUSHTHA (Psoriasis)</strong>
        <p>
            Ensure strengthening of the tissues and complete healing of the skin, nourishing herbs are used and administered.
            For vatha dominated psoriasis, treatments such as Snehana (oral administration of medicated ghee/oil), Steam Bath, 
            Virechana (purgation performed by giving medicated laxatives),Vamana (medicated vomiting) and vasthi (medicated enema) are administered.
            For pitha dominated psoriasis, treatments such as Snehana, Dhara (with medicated butter milk or decoction) or medical purgation are administered.
             As Psoriasis is a chronic disease, there is a possibility that the vitiated doshas affect deeper tissues or channels. 
             Thus, it becomes crucial to nourish and revitalise the skin after treatment. For this, multiple rejuvenation techniques and treatments are used.

      <li>
        <strong>YAUVANPIDIKA or Acne Vulgaris</strong>
        <p>
            Ayurvedic treatments to cure acne include steam (to unblock the channels), virechana (purgation performed by giving medicated laxatives),
            vamana (medicated vomiting to clear toxins and unblock clogged channels), rakthamoksham (blood-letting). Apart from these treatments,
            medicated and natural herbs are used (in the form of lepams or oral intake) to treat acne.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>KILASA/SWITRA or Vitiligo (Leucoderma)</strong>
        <p>
            Vitiligo is caused due to the imbalance of all the three doshas (Vatha, Pitha & Kapha) vitiating the Rakta, Mamsa and Medhas dhatus. Consumption of incompatible food items (virrudh ahaar sewan) results in formation of toxins int he body.
            These toxins disturb the immune system, causing the pigment producing melanocytes cells to degenerate. Ayurveda predicates a four pronged to treat Vitiligo: 
            1) Nidana parithyaga (avoidance of all causative factors); 2) Shodhana Chiktsa (intense detoxification through Panchakarma in which treatments such as Vamana, 
            Virechana and Rakthamoksham are administered); Shamana Chikitsa (administered thorough oral medications and external applications) and 4) Patya (following the correct lifestyle and food habits, including yoga and meditation)
